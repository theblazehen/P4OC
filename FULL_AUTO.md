- At start, do beads ticket maintenance
- If you have tickets, handle them and test all changes
- Once they're all complete, exhaustively bug test and make sure the app works well.
- Commit your changes
- Once all implemented stuff works perfectly, figure out what's the next incremental improvement we can make to the application, spec it out to a file, create implementation tickets, go to start
- I'm trusting you to use your own judgement here
- If you get stuck for too long, you can call in another llm with `codex exec`
- I suggest if you're at risk for running a command that could block, that you run it in tmux
- Keep updating your notes as you learn
- If you get stuck on something for over 20 min, it's probably time to call out to codex. If that doesn't help, move on to another task
- There's a lot of ui jank, which we wanna eliminate if possible
- our ideal ui is similar to that of https://github.com/btriapitsyn/openchamber
- We need to strictly comply with https://opencode.ai/docs/server/
- Make use of the adb that's available and the automation tools you have
- The opencode server is 192.168.24.25:4096
- Don't delete any opencode sessions, or use any of the recent ones in the list
- keep your beads up to date always
- you have enough work to do, if you run out of tickets, find something new to do
- screenshots DO NOT WORK - don't bother trying
- When you run out of stuff to do, don't just loop looking at beads, kick off a preemptive search for improvements - in a subagent to get out of tunnel mode if you must

--- Once all tickets are complete, then exhaustively test all functionality
